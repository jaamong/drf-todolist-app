* LoginAPIVIew:
`email = request.data.get('email', None) `
password = request.data.get('password', None)
 -> when a user doesn't send these keys, gate will throw a `KeyError`.
     so first, what you want to do is do 'None' here.
** authenticate
 `from django.contrib.auth import authenticate`
then in post method,
 ` user = authenticate(authenticate target)`
if user, then log them in and send them token. -> token : `pip install pyjwt`, `import jwt`
 -> `pyjwt` is a module that enables us to work with authoring JWT tokens.
      decoding and encoding them .. all those kinds of things.
--> remeber we have a property on the user model: `@property def token`
